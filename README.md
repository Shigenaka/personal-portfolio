1. What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
https://staff.washington.edu/mshig19/info343/personal-portfolio

I did this by myself except I used the template from class to get started :D

3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
8ish hours.

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
I actually really enjoyed this one, I felt like everything was explained well and I didn't really feel too confused, introducing Mr. Data Converter in class was nice, I ended up using that to turn my data into a JSON object and then used angular $http to get it.
